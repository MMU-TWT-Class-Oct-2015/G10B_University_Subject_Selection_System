# G10B_University_Subject_Selection_System

**Introduction about system**
-------------

The title of this assignment is student register system. As we know, student register system is very important system for every university. This system not only let admin can show out those subject can be register next semester, can also distinguish the subject can be added by student or not. As a student register website, this system is also convenience to admin and student click button to enter and modify data by using their own internet.

 We already create this system for ABQ University to help admin easily register student account, post up subject, modify subject information, manage and storage student data. For the student, they can using their student ID and password given by admin to login this system for choose and add their subject. Thus, this system is important no matter student or admin.

All these just a basic concept regarding our system work-flow. More details will include in below section such as screenshot of our project functionality and so on. We are actually aim to reduce workload of both admin and student because without a systematic system policy, student might need to add subject manually which resulted time wasted, human error increase and this also consider as a not efficient work process.
