**Introduction about system**
-------------

The title of this assignment is student register system. As we know, student register system is very important system for every university. This system not only let admin can show out those subject can be register next semester, can also distinguish the subject can be added by student or not. As a student register website, this system is also convenience to admin and student click button to enter and modify data by using their own internet.

 We already create this system for ABQ University to help admin easily register student account, post up subject, modify subject information, manage and storage student data. For the student, they can using their student ID and password given by admin to login this system for choose and add their subject. Thus, this system is important no matter student or admin.

All these just a basic concept regarding our system work-flow. More details will include in below section such as screenshot of our project functionality and so on. We are actually aim to reduce workload of both admin and student because without a systematic system policy, student might need to add subject manually which resulted time wasted, human error increase and this also consider as a not efficient work process.

**Objectives of the project**
-------------------

We are provide student register system to ABQ University. Also, for the admin able to create an ID and password to student, add, modify or delete the subject from register list. This student register system can help both side admin and student saving time. This is because students have their own ID can register subject, and no longer need to spend time to queue to facing admin or fill in register form.

Besides that, this system will make human error decrease. This is because website automatic checking the student ID, student name whether format error or data already exist and show out that was an error. So, this system will also reduce human mistake and easily using by admin and students.

By using this system, the university also became easily to manage student information because the subject had be chosen by students will record in the database. When the database recorded those information, admin not need spend another time to key in those information to achieve double benefit for admin.

**Contribution of the project**
-------------

This student register system is specifically for University to use it, because primary school and high school not so much student they have to record, only university have thousand of student with different courses and faculty need to record. Without this student register system, university will become spend more money, time and energy to manage the information about student.

By using this system, University staff can be the admin of the system. He will able help the  student register a account and give them a specific password to let them manage account them own. Besides that, admin also update or renew the subject by subject code, subject title, which year of student register it and so on. The subject will be upload to student webpage to let them choose which subject student wan to register. Also, admin is able to edit their profile such as admin ID, password or adding the account of admin.

Student will be the user in this system, after admin give them their account and password. Student is able to add the subject form the subject list upload by admin, the year 1 student only can add the subject study by year 1, other subject will be invisible such as year 2 and 3.It is prevent student accidentally pick wrong subject not for them. After student adding subject in the cart, the subject will enrol for them in next semester.

**Conclusion**
--------------------

Eventually, we sincerely hope that our system can really bring a lot of convenience to every user who might using on in the coming future. Our team already put much effort during develop the system interface, design, especially the most complicated one PHP code. Since we still novice in this field, hence, we hope that we can improve ourselves by learning more from website, expert, also gain new knowledge from lecture during class so that we might able to working on students register system in large scale with uniqueness of functionality which can easier userâ€™s life.
